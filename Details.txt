Questions From Candidates:
  mostly while using MUI, I observed that we are using inline styling(sx). When I tried to use normal css file styling, most of the times, it is getting overridden by the mui styles. How could we avoid that sir? 
  I also tried using !important. It worked for few scenarios, but not for all.

  How to stop the render till some condition satisfied.
  conditional return '' before return of actual DOM
